# cim-compare

>   Command line tool for generating CIM model comparison reports.

## CIM Model Comparison Report Utility

**cim-compare** generates model comparison reports between two points in time.
The term “target” is used to describe some current (or later) version of the CIM that is to be the target of the comparison. The term “baseline” is used to describe the **historical** model against which the “target” model is to be compared to determine what has changed.

Enterprise Architect (Corporate Edition and above) has the capability to perform these model comparisons; however, the feature is not generally useful as results are only exportable as XML files that are not easily human consumable.

The output generated by **cim-compare** results in a self-contained HTML comparison report of all changes between a “baseline” and “target” model. The report is viewable in most standard browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc. and provides the ability to search for specific CIM classes within the report.

Reports use colors to visually indicate changes to packages, classes, attributes and associations. New items are shown in green, deleted items are in red, items that have moved location within the model appear as yellow, blue represents items that were changed in some way, and finally violet is reserved for items that are unchanged.

Finally, when CIM standards are published (e.g. IEC 61970-301, IEC 61968-11 or IEC 62325-301) it is often desirable to include an informational report of all model-related changes since the prior publication of the standard. The comparison reports produced by **cim-compare** can potentially be used to meet such requirements.

## Command Line Usage

**cim-compare** has two possible command-line usages to produce comparison reports.

### Option \#1: EA Model Comparison Logs as Input

The first option is by specifying an **EA model comparison log** file as input. This particular usage takes the following form:

```
java -jar cim-compare.jar <comparison-results-xml-file> [<output-directory-or-html-file>] [--<iec-package-name>]
```

*Parameter Details*:

**\<comparison-results-xml-file\> (Required):** The model comparison file. When not specified as an absolute file path the location of the file is assumed to be the directory the utility is being executed in.

**[\<output-directory-or-html-file\>] (Optional):** An output directory or an output HTML file. In the case where a directory is specified for this parameter it must exist or execution will terminate with an appropriate error. When an HTML file is provided it may be specified as an absolute file path or as simply the name of the HTML file to be generated. If not specified then the application\ will generate an HTML file whose name is derived from the two input files.

**[--\<iec-package-name\>] (Optional):** The root package to compare and generate the comparison report on. Appearing at the end of the command-line, the package must exist in both the baseline and target models (e.g. --IEC61970, --IEC61968, --IEC62325, --TC57CIM, etc.) and be specified with two leading dashes (-). Note that when no IEC package name is specified that the report is generated from the root package in the models.

### Option \#2: XMI Baseline and Target Models as Inputs

The second usage option allows one to bypass Enterprise Architect and directly specify two XMI 1.1 compliant files representing the "baseline" and "target" models respectively. In this scenario the command-line usage takes the following form:

```
java -jar cim-compare.jar <baseline-model-xmi-file> <target-model-xmi-file> [<output-directory-or-html-file>] [--<iec-package-name>]
```

*Parameter Details*:

**\<baseline-model-xmi-file\>** (**Required**): An XMI 1.1 compliant baseline model file exported from EA. When not specified as an absolute file path the location of the file is assumed to be the directory the utility is being executed from.

**\<target-model-xmi-file\>** (**Required**): An XMI 1.1 compliant target model file exported from EA. When not specified as an absolute file path the location of the file is assumed to be the directory the utility is being executed from.

**[\<output-directory-or-html-file\>] (Optional)**: An output directory or an output HTML file. In the case where a directory is specified for this parameter it must exist or execution will terminate with an appropriate error. When an HTML file is provided it may be specified as an absolute file path or as simply the name of the HTML file to be generated. If not specified then the application will generate an HTML file whose name is derived from the two input files.

**[--\<iec-package-name\>] (Optional):** The root package within the models from which to start the comparison report from. Appearing at the end of the command-line, when specified the package must exist in both the baseline and target models (e.g. --IEC61970, --IEC61968, --IEC62325, --TC57CIM, etc.) and be specified with two leading dashes (-). Note that when no IEC package name is specified that the report is generated from the root package in the models.

## Java Technical Requirements

**cim-compare** ships as a fully self-contained executable jar file with no external dependencies.  It has been tested and confirmed to run successfully using Java 1.8  through Java 12.

Given the large file sizes consumed and produced by the utility, **OutOfMemory** exceptions occur if either the default heap size is used or too little heap is allocated on the command line. The following guidelines should be followed:

> For a 32-bit JRE it is recommended to specify a max heap size of at least 1G
    (i.e. 1024m) resources permitting. With a 1G heap size the execution will
    typically run a little slower. Note that the maximum theoretical heap limit
    for a 32-bit JVM is 4G. However, due to various additional constraints such
    as available swap, kernel address space usage, memory fragmentation, and VM
    overhead, in practice the limit can be much lower. On most modern 32-bit
    Windows systems the maximum heap size will range from 1.4G to 1.6G.

> For 64 bit JREs it is recommended that the maximum heap size be increased to at least 2G (i.e. 2048m) if available. It has been observed that 2G is usually sufficient to handle the largest CIM files one might encounter.
